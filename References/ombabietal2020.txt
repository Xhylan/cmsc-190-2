Literature Review
Unsupervised Approach
## Summary of the passage:

**Topic:** Different Approaches to Sentiment Analysis (SA)

Key Points:
* Clustering-based approach:
    * Uses TF-IDF to extract features based on term frequency and importance.
    * Examples: K-means clustering, MRF feature selection + K-means, TF-IDF + WordNet + operator.
    * Advantages: Can handle large datasets, identify topics and clusters.
    * Disadvantages: Relies on feature selection, may not capture complex sentiment nuances.
* Lexicon-based approach:
    * Uses a pre-built dictionary of words with assigned sentiment scores.
    * Examples: Lu et al.'s adjective-adverb strength calculation, Eirinaki et al.'s High Adjective Count and Max Opinion Score algorithms, Sasmita et al.'s indicator words for aspect extraction.
    * Advantages: Simple and efficient, easy to interpret results.
    * Disadvantages: Limited to words in the dictionary, may not handle sarcasm or slang.
* Hybrid approach:
    * Combines features from both clustering and lexicon-based methods.
    * Example: Pawar and Deshmukh's N-gram, POS features + ML classifiers.
    * Advantages: Can leverage strengths of both approaches, handle complex sentiment patterns.
    * Disadvantages: More complex to implement, requires careful feature engineering.
Overall:
The passage discusses the pros and cons of two main approaches to sentiment analysis, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios. It also mentions hybrid approaches that combine both methods for potentially better results.
Additional notes:
